    The answer is: [A snowman was built by human in the yard, and the snow has since melted because the weather turn hot, leaving the eyes(coal), nose(carrot), mouth(coal), and scarf(scarf) on the ground.]
    
    You should respond to the playerâ€™s guesses with only "yes", "no", or "doesn\'t relate".
